$ GLOBAL SPACING NOTE:
$ Some of these messages are used in table formats, therefore the
$ spacing is very important to the formatting of the data.
$ The spacing between the two columns is forced by specifying the minimum
$ width when printing the numbers.  The width specified is generally much
$ wider than necessary to print the number and the extra width is for column
$ alignment.  However, the double precision numbers "%-xx.0f" must have a
$ minimum of 20 characters.  The decimal numbers "%-xxd" must have a minimum
$ of 11 characters.  If the translated words in the first column have a
$ number of characters different than the original words, the width specified
$ for the number must be changed.
