*	Message for comb SCCS command
*
-1
Cannot use the comb command while there is an outstanding delta
	to the file.
	Use the delta command or the unget command; then use the comb command.
	A p-file exists which shows that someone is in the process of making a
	delta on the specified SCCS file.  The comb command may only be used when
	no one else is modifying the specified SCCS file.

-2
The -p flag and the -c flag are mutually exclusive.
	The -p flag specifies the SID of the oldest delta for the resulting procedure
	to preserve. All older deltas are combined in the reconstructed file.
	The -c flag specifies a list of deltas (SIDs) that the shell procedure will
	preserve. The procedure combines all other deltas.

-4
The flags specified on the command line would create no changes
	to the SCCS file.
	The comb command as specified cannot do anything to the specified SCCS file.
