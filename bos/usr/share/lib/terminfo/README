	The Terminfo library contains terminal descriptions for various
	terminals.  The source for the terminal descriptions are stored
	in the *.ti files in /usr/share/lib/terminfo.  /usr/bin/tic is used
	to compile the source files into terminfo binaries. 

        The binaries are stored in the subdirectory which has the first
        letter of the binary's name. For example, vt220-pc.ti is located under
        /usr/share/lib/terminfo/ and its binary output (which is
        vt220-pc) is located under /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt220-pc.
        The same convention is followed with all the files.

	The following commands are shipped with the bos.terminfo package.  

                  /usr/bin/tic			terminfo compiler
                  /usr/bin/captoinfo		termcap to terminfo converter
                  /usr/bin/infocmp		compares terminfo binaries
						(may also be used to convert a
						 terminfo binary into source.)

	Some of the terminfo capability and termcap code names have changed
	between AIX V4 and AIX V3.  Applications which use the AIX V3 terminfo
	capability names should still be o.k.   Binaries for termcap applications 
	should still execute properly in AIX V4.  Termcap applications may need to make
	modifications before re-compiling or port to terminfo as an alternative.
	Since support for termcap may not be available in future releases of AIX,
	porting to terminfo is strongly encouraged.

	The differences are:

			AIX4					AIX3
			-----					-----

	VARIABLE	TERMINFO   TERMCAP      VARIABLE      TERMINFO    TERMCAP
	--------        --------   ------       --------      --------    -------
	init_3string	"is3"	   "i3"	       init_3string    "is3"	  "i2"
	key_btab        "kcbt"     "kB"	       key_back_tab    "kbtab"    "kO"
	key_command     "kcmd"     "@4"        key_command     "kcmd"     "kc"
	key_end         "kend"     "@7"        key_end         "kend"     "kw"
	key_help        "khlp"     "%1"        key_help        "khlp"     "kq"
	key_select      "kslt"     "*6"        key_select      "ksel"     "kU"
	key_sf10	"ksf10"    "S0"        key_sf10	       "ksf10"    "SA"

	In addition to the above differences, variables key_f11 through key_f63 have
	different termcap code names in AIX V4 than AIX V3.  This may effect termcap
	applications which are using AIX V4 curses routines.  

	The terminfo capability names are the same.
