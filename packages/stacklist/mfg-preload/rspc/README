This directory contains manufacturing preload files that are to be used
by Raliegh manufacturing to preload Sandalfoot and Sandalbow systems with
AIXv4. These files:
	preload		preload customization script
	preload.bnd     preload auto install customization list - Sandalfoot
	preload.bnd.40p preload auto install customization list - Sandalbow 
	preload.dat     preload customization data - Sandalfoot
	preload.ver	preload verification script

must be placed on a dos formatted diskette in the DOS directory \. For
Sandalbow systems, the preload.bnd.40p and preload.dat.40p files must be
written to the DOS \ directory as preload.bnd, and preload.dat respectively. 

The preload file contains a script that bos install will read from the diskette
and execute. This script currently reads in the preload.dat file and if
correctly read copies it over the default bosinst.data file. It then reads the
preload.ver preload verification script file to be executed at the end of 
bos install. It optionally attempts to read a preload.bnd file that can 
contain a list of lpps, or filesets contained on the installation media to 
preload after bos has been preloaded. The preload, preload.dat and preload.ver
files are required. The preload.bnd file is optional. If this bundle file is
not present, the type of bundle specified in the preload.dat file will
drive the auto installation of LPPs and filesets.

The preload.bnd file is currently a copy of the Personal Productivity bundle
file shipped with the system. The intent is to be able to tailor this file
for PPS PowerDesktop preload content.

The preload.bnd.40p file is currently a copy of the  Graphical Client
bundle with the additions of desktop and SoftWindows.

The preload.dat file is a bosinst.data (bosinstall data) file with the following
conditions set:
		No Console
		No Prompt
		Install on Largest hardfile
		Personal AIX Install Type
		Always install Graphical System
		Overwrite existing system
		preload.verify as verification file (copy of preload.ver)
		Remove inst roots component (not a NIM server install)
		Auto Install bundle - preload.bnd

The preload.dat.40p file is the same as the peload.dat file with the 
exception of INSTALL_TYPE is Client instead of Personal.
Note that since the installation cdrom MUST be removed after install and 
before they system reboots, bos install will perform a shutdown when 
installing a rspc system (Sandalfoot) instead of a reboot as in the case of
a RS6K system. This means that the only indication that manufacturing has
that install has completed is to wait the appropriate period of time and then
check the contents of the customization DOS diskette.

The preload verification script (preload.ver) will use doswrite to write
information concerning the install status to the DOS diskette in the \
directory. This script will write a file called preload.log which contains a
copy of the devinstall.log file found in /var/adm/ras/devinst.log which 
contains the install log (-e output from installp) from the preload session.
It also will write a preload.sum file which is the installp summary file
found in /var/adm/sw/installp.summary. This file contains colon separated 
records of which filesets were installed and what the status of each fileset
was. In addition the preload verification script will scan the summary file
and if all filesets were installed successfully (0 status code) will write
a file called SUCCESS to the \ directory on the DOS diskette. If any
error was detected, a file called FAILED will be written. Of course if the
install did not get to the point of executing the verification script, no
files will be written to the DOS diskette, again indicating failure. Once
the preload script determines that everything has installed with no reported
errors, it will scan the installp.summary file to determine if SoftWindows was
installed. If it was installed, it will ensure that the system has at least
48Meg of paging space defined. If it does not, it will increase the paging 
space using chps to obtain 48Meg, which is the minimum required to operate
SoftWindows in the desktop environment. Note that paging space will not be
increased if SoftWindows was not installed. If the chps is issued and fails,
the status written for preinstall with be FAILED.

It is required that manufacturing ensure that the STATUS and FAILED files along
with the PRELOAD.SUM and PRELOAD.LOG files are deleted from the diskette when
starting a new install.

The DOS diskette MUST be in the diskette drive when install is started. Reading
of the DOS diskette is only available when installing from the CDROM media.
It is NOT available when installing from the network or TAPE.

This installation setup will install the personal AIX type of Operating System
onto the system, including the Graphical Operating System components, without
needing a console or keyboard installed. The graphics display adapter MUST
be installed, however a monitor need not be attached..
