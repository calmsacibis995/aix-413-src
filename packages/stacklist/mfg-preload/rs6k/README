The following information is to be used in assisting the implementation of
preload for AIXv4 on RS6K systems.

Austin preload of AIX can be customized in several ways depending on what the
customer specified. 
			- Preload AIXv4 Advanced Server
				- Minimum Installation
				- Client Bundle
				- Server Bundle
				- Personal Productivity Bundle
				- Application Development Bundle
				- Hardware Diagnostics Bundle
				
			- Preload AIXv4 Client
				- Personal Productivity Bundle
				- Application Development Bundle

Note that Product Planning (Vicki Griffin) will determine what bundles and
combinations of bundles may be selected by the customer for preload. 
			
While AIXv4 is available as two offerings: AIXv4 Advanced Server and
					   AIXv4 Client
both types of installations can be preinstalled from one CDROM type:
		AIXv4 Advanced Server

There are two ways to facilitate this. One method is to utilize a customized
bosinst.data file with the INSTALL_TYPE entry specifying either full or client.
This however requires a diskette be present in the drive containing the 
customized bosinst.data file and the necessary signature file. A second method
is to use the default installation of Advanced Server and utilize a post 
install script to further customize the system. To revert the system from 
Advanced minimum install to Client Minimum install, the following steps will
need to be taken:
			Deinstall bos.sysmgt.loginlic
			Remove the following links in 
				/usr/sys/inst.data/sys_bundles:
					Client.bnd
					Server.bnd
					
This assumes, that the system hardware is a configuration that is supported
by Client. For example async cards 8 port, 16 port, 64 port etc, are not 
provided on Client Systems. If a card exists on a system that is being
preinstalled for Client using an Advanced Server CD, that device support will
be installed. It would have to be deinstalled in the post install script. 

The post installation script must also remove the following file
		/var/adm/sw/__assistinfo
This will ensure that the installation assistant menu tailoring is correct
for preinstalled systems.

The installation verification script can determine the success of installation
by utilizing the installp summary file found in /var/adm/sw/installp.summary.
In addition, additional information can be obtained from the device install
log found in /var/adm/ras/devinst.log. For problem assistance, a boot log
may be obtained by using the command alog -t boot -o . 


It should also be noted that additional flexability has been added to the
bosinst.data file for preload situations:

	CONSOLE value can be set to "none" designating that NO Console is
	to be used during bos install. Console output is NOT SAVED in this
	case and PROMPT must be set to no. (This capability was requested by
	RALEIGH manufacturing for Sandalfoots.) 

	INSTALL_X_IF_ADPATER: can be set to "all" This will force bos install
			      to always Graphical auto install bundle even if
			      the console is NOT and LFT.       

One of two methods may also be utilized for custom bundle installs such as 
Client, Personal Productivity, Server, Application Development, Hardware
Diagnostics. The first method again depends upon a customized bosinst.data
file read from diskette. An entry call BUNDLES may be set to specify a 
bundle file to be automatically installed by bos install following it's normal
auto install of software. Only a single bundle file is allowed here, however
it specify a bundle file shipped with the system (such as found in 
/usr/sys/inst.data/sys_bundles, or it can be a customized bundle file that
is on the diskette itself. For example this customized bundle file could be
a combination of several bundles, if the customer requested more than one.

The second method is to utilize the sm_inst command during a post install     
customization/verification script to install the requested bundle or bundles.
This would be executed after the system has been rebooted. 
 
The following is a list of sizes and times for installing the various
combinations of AIX and it's bundles. This will be updated periodically since
this data is measured for every build, and continues to change. 
This data is a copy of the information obtained by Rajiv Jahari in the
