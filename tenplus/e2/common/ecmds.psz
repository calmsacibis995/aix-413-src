$ TRANSLATOR:  In this file, many command (function) names are used.
$ They are all in UPPER CASE.  They should not be translated.
$ Examples:  BOX-MARK, ENTER, TAB, RIGHT-ARROW, and many more.
$ The sequences (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) and (8) are command names, and
$ should be left unchanged.
$ A "popup box" is a small box that appears on the screen on top of
$ whatever was there before, and contains a short message.  When the popup
$ box is removed from the screen, the former contents of the screen reappear.
$ The word "pick" is used to describe picking up text from the file that is
$ being edited (the text disappears from the file), and storing it in a
$ temporary buffer.
$ The word "put" is used to describe the opposite action -- inserting the
$ text into the file being edited.

Functions (1) to (8) perform operations specific to certain kinds of data,\n\
or invoke options when any menu appears.  Press LOCAL-MENU to receive a\n\
menu of these functions.  You can select either the Local Menu option from\n\
the menu, or use (1) - (8) directly.  You do not have to display the menu.\n\
Each function key corresponds to a line on the menu.  You can also invoke\n\
these options when viewing any menu; normally, the first option can be\n\
invoked using (1), the second invoked using (2), and so on.  In certain\n\
situations, you can provide parameters to these functions, using the\n\
following sequence:\n\
  o Press ENTER\n\
  o Enter the desired parameter\n\
  o Press the appropriate function key.\n\

used when you are editing a text file, and the new window must also\n\
contain a text file.  WINDOW creates a new window and puts the current\n\
file in it.  The sequence ENTER File WINDOW creates a new window that\n\
contains the specified file.\n\
\n\
The position of the new window is determined by the cursor position at\n\
the time you press WINDOW.  If the cursor is on the top line of the\n\
current window, a vertical window is created. The current window is\n\
split by a vertical line going through the current cursor position,\n\
and the new window is the area to the right of this line.  If the\n\
cursor is not on the top line of the window, a horizontal window is\n\
created. The current window is split by a horizontal line going through\n\
the cursor, and the new window is the area below this line."
