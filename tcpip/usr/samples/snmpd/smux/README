(1) The SMUX proxy agent code is provided only as examples.

    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP. PROVIDES THIS SOURCE CODE
    EXAMPLE "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  The entire
    risk as to the quality and performance of this example is with you.
    Should any part of this source code example prove defective you (and
    not IBM or an IBM authorized dealer) assume the entire cost of all
    necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

    If you should experience problems using the SMUX user interface or
    any of the SMUX example files, there is an internet mail address to
    which you can direct your SMUX concerns for these examples.  Please
    send mail to smux@bach.austin.ibm.com stating your questions and/or
    problems.  Please include your return internet mail address in your
    note.  We cannot guarantee that we will provide you with an answer,
    but we will attempt to answer all queries concerning the SMUX interface.
    In the event that the above internet address becomes inaccessible,
    please follow the normal problem reporting procedures.

(2) The following files, which may be of interest to you, are shipped with
    snmpd:
       /usr/lib/libisode.a
       /usr/lib/libsnmp.a
       associated include files under the /usr/include/isode directory
       associated files under the /etc directory:
          /etc/isoaliases
          /etc/isobjects
          /etc/isoentities
          /etc/isomacros
          /etc/isoservices

(3) The SMUX protocol Request For Comments (RFC) is provided in the
    following file:
      /usr/samples/snmpd/smux/rfc1227.txt.

(4) The libraries you will need to link with your SMUX proxy agents
    are:
       /usr/lib/libisode.a
       /usr/lib/libsnmp.a
    The /usr/samples/snmpd/smux/Makefile provides the rules for this linkage.

(5) See infoExplorer for the manpages on the libisode.a and libsnmp.a
    subroutines.  There is a logging file that is shipped as
    /usr/samples/snmpd/smux/isodetailor that is referred to by the isodetailor
    subroutine.

(6) Remember to update the /etc/snmpd.conf and /etc/snmpd.peers files
    to reflect your proxy agent.

(7) The mosy command will generate c code for the definitions of your
    private MIB variables which can be compiled into your SMUX proxy agent.  
    The mosy command usage is:

    mosy -c output_c_file [-x output_desc_file] [-o output_defs_file] [-s] inputfile...

    where: output_c_file is the full path and filename of the output file
	   into which mosy will place the generated c code; output_desc_file,
	   output_defs_file, and inputfile are as described in the mosy 
	   documentation.

    See the documentation for further information about the mosy command.
