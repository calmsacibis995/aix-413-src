This DPI PING SNMP proxy agent code is provided as an example to
demonstrate the use of the DPI facility.

    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP. PROVIDES THIS SOURCE CODE
    EXAMPLE "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  The entire
    risk as to the quality and performance of this example is with you.
    Should any part of this source code example prove defective you (and
    not IBM or an IBM authorized dealer) assume the entire cost of all
    necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

The DPI PING SNMP proxy agent allows an SNMP network management station to
request a remote SNMP agent to perform ICMP ECHO ("ping") requests to a
specified IP host.  This is useful for determining delays across a link from
the perspective of the remote host.

The "ping_eng" executable must be compiled as only the source code is
provided.  A Makefile has been provided and is ready to use "as is".   This
Makefile is shipped in the file, /usr/samples/snmpd/dpi/ping_eng/Makefile.  To
compile the ping_eng DPI peer executable, at the shell prompt enter:
  make


The PING engine must run as root user because it needs to open a raw socket.
It may be easiest to have it set-uid root:
  su
  Password:
  chown root ping_eng
  chmod u+s ping_eng
		
The PING engine takes two arguments.  The first is the host on which the SNMP
agent is running and the second is the community name to use to inquire what
the DPI port is.  To execute the ping_eng DPI peer, enter at the shell
prompt:
  ./ping_eng <localhost> <community>
      where:  <localhost> specifies the local host name or IP address
                          or the word, localhost.
              <community> specifies a community name with read/write
			  access.
		  
The MIB variables supported by the ping_eng DPI peer are listed in the 
/usr/samples/snmpd/dpi/ping_eng/ping_eng.my file.

You need to update the /etc/mib.defs file so that you can test the MIB
variable support via the snmpinfo command.  The Makefile produces a MIB
definition file named ping_eng.defs.  Concatenate ping_eng.defs to the bottom
of the /etc/mib.defs file *BEFORE* you run the snmpinfo command.

Make sure that the dpid SMUX peer is executing *BEFORE* you start the
ping_eng DPI peer.
