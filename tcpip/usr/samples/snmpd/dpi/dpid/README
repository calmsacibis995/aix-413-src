This DPI to SMUX converter proxy agent source code is provided as an example
to:
  * convert the DPI protocol to SMUX protocol, 
  * illustrate a SMUX peer, and
  * illustrate how to force a program to fork and separate from the tty
    so that it runs in the background forever.

    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP. PROVIDES THIS SOURCE CODE
    EXAMPLE "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  The entire
    risk as to the quality and performance of this example is with you.
    Should any part of this source code example prove defective you (and
    not IBM or an IBM authorized dealer) assume the entire cost of all
    necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

The DPI to SMUX proxy agent, dpid, converts the DPI protocol to the SMUX
protocol.  When the dpid daemon is running, DPI peers, or subagents,
communicate with dpid via the DPI protocol.  The dpid daemon converts the
information into the SMUX protocol and interfaces with snmpd.  Thus, snmpd
only knows about the dpid SMUX peer.  snmpd does not know about the DPI
peers that are communicating with dpid.

The dpid executable must be compiled as only the source code is provided.
A Makefile has been provided and is ready to use "as is".   This Makefile is
shipped in the file, /usr/samples/snmpd/dpi/dpid/Makefile.  To compile the 
dpid DPI to SMUX protocol converter executable, at the shell prompt enter:
  make

The dpid SMUX peer must run as root user.  It may be easiest to have it
set-uid root:
  su
  Password:
  chown root dpid
  chmod u+s dpid
		
Before you execute the dpid daemon, you will need to update the 
/etc/snmpd.peers files by adding the following entry for dpid:
"dpid"       1.3.6.1.4.1.2.3.1.2.2.1.1.2       "dpid_password"

You will also need to update the /etc/snmpd.conf file by adding a smux entry 
for dpid:
smux        1.3.6.1.4.1.2.3.1.2.2.1.1.2 	dpid_password     #dpid

Refresh snmpd so that it will reread the /etc/snmpd.conf file:
  refresh -s snmpd

Start the dpid SMUX peer:
  dpid

Using snmpinfo, walk the smux MIB tree to see that dpid has registered
successfully.  The dump should also show that the dpiSMUXport subtree has
been registered successfully.
  /usr/sbin/snmpinfo -v -md smux

The dpid object id as defined above is "1.3.6.1.4.1.2.3.1.2.2.1.1.2".  The
breakdown of the dotted notation is:
  1  iso
  3  org
  6  dod
  1  internet
  4  private
  1  enterprises
  2  ibm
  3  ibmAgents
  1  aix
  2  aixRISC6000
  2  risc6000private
  1  risc6000samples
  1  risc6000sampleAgents
  2  dpid
