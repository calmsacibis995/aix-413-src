#
# This file identifies gateways for the routing daemon (routed).
# Ordinarily, routed queries the network and builds routing tables
# from routing information transmitted by other hosts that are
# directly connected to the network.  However, there may be gateways
# that routed cannot identify through its queries, called distant
# gateways.  Such gateways may be identified in this file which
# routed reads when it starts.
#
# The format of this file is:
#
# <destination>  <name1>  gateway  <name2>  metric  <value>  <type>
#
#  where
#	<destination>	A keyword that indicates whether the route is 
#			to a network or to a specific host.  The two
#			valid keywords are net and host.
#
#	<name1>		The name associated with destination.  <name1>
#			can be either a symbolic name or an Internet
#			address in dotted decimal format.
#
#	gateway		Indicates following string identifies the gateway
#			host.
#
#	<name2>		Name or address of gateway host to which messages
#			should be forwarded.
#
#	metric		Incidates following string is hop count to
#			destination host or network.
#
#	<value>		Hop count.
#
#	<type>		A keyword that indicates how the gateway should
#			be treated.  The two valid keywords are active
#			and passive.  
#
# A '#' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end
# of the line are not interpreted by routines which search this file.
# Blank lines are allowed in this file.
# 
# An example entry follows.  Tailor this file to your system.
