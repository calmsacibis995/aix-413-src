Telnet:     
     1)	Telnet must allow transmission of eight bit characters when not in
	binary mode in order to implement ISO 8859 Latin code page.  This is
	necessary for internationalization of the TCP/IP commands.

     2)	In order to support new character sets, the following was added to the
	hft-m, ibm5081, hft, hft-nam, hft-c, aixterm-m and aixterm entries:

        box1=\154\161\153\170\152\155\167\165\166\164\156,      batt1=f1,
        box2=\154\161\153\170\152\155\167\165\166\164\156,      batt2=f1md,
        font0=\E(B,     font1=\E(0,


Adding -net, -host -netmask flags and -xns family using SMIT:
	The SMIT tool lacks the ability to specify -net -host or -netmask
	flags or family -xns when manipulating network routes.  If the usage
	of these flags becomes necessary, the routes must be manipulated
	using the route command. This is a temporary restriction.
	The SMIT tool will add a host route if the DESTINATION Address
	(dotted decimal) has all four numbers (e.g. 9.8.7.6).  It will add
	a net route if the DESTINATION Address is less than four numbers
	(e.g. 9.8.7 or 9).  This is not always the desired affect.
	To add these routes on reboot simply add the needed routes to the
	/etc/rc.net (or /etc/rc.bsdnet if you have chosen to do BSD style
	configuration).

Changing Network Interface Information with a remotely mounted /usr:
	The chgif command, that is called by chdev (used by SMIT) now checks
	to see if /usr is remotely mounted before changing the network
	interface information.  If /usr is found to be remotely mounted then
	any changes made to the network interfaces only take place in the
	information database (ODM).
	So to get the network interface changes to take affect the machine
	needs to be rebooted or the ifconfig command can be used to change
	the network interface information.  If the system is rebooted then
	the new information will be read from the ODM database.  If a reboot
	is not desired then the ifconfig command can be used to make the
	network interface information take place right away.
	The system administrator of a system that has a remotely mounted /usr
	should be very careful not to modify the interface used to mount
	the remote /usr.  Since the libraries, commands and kernel reside
	in /usr.

Security Concerns with Anonymous FTP:
	When creating anonymous ftp users and directories please be sure that
	the home directory for users ftp and anonymous (ie. /u/ftp) is owned by
	root and does not allow write permissions (ie. dr-xr-xr-x).  The
	script /usr/lpp/tcpip/samples/anon.ftp can be used to create these
	accounts, files and directories.

Network Migration

       1.  TCP/IP

       The configuration files are saved in /lpp/save.config/etc.
       The file	from the previous release is named <filename>.old,
       and the shipped file (the one that would	be there if you	did
       a reinstall) is <filename>.new.	For example, when
       /etc/rc.tcpip is	migrated,

	  - /etc/rc.tcpip has been upgraded with your information
	    kept.

	  - /lpp/save.config/etc/rc.tcpip.old is your old rc.tcpip
	    file.

	  - /lpp/save.config/etc/rc.tcpip.new is the new version
	    (without your changes) that	was shipped.

       The following files are migrated:

	  o /etc/rc.net

	  o /etc/rc.bsdnet

	  o /etc/services

	    Here, all the services previously defined will be kept.
	    The	4.1 /etc/services file contains	all the	defined
	    services from the RFCs.  Where a conflict exists
	    between a service you have previously defined and a
	    globally defined service (from an RFC), your service
	    will be kept and the official one commented	out.

	  o /etc/inetd.conf

	  o /etc/rc.tcpip

	  o /etc/bootptab

	  o /etc/3270.keys

	  o /etc/3270keys.hft

       In most cases your TCP/IP configuration will migrate
       cleanly.	 If you	have made substantial changes to any of	the
       above files you will want to make sure everything you had
       done is still working.

       2.  NFS_and_NIS

       The /etc/rc.nfs and /var/yp/Makefile files are NOT migrated.
       However,	your old files are saved in
       /lpp/saveconfig/etc/rc.nfs and
       /lpp/save.config/var/yp/Makefile.

       This means that you will	have to	configure your NIS domain
       name before a NIS client	will work.

       For NIS servers,	the NIS	databases are unchanged, but
       remember	that rc.nfs and	the Makefile are replaced.  You
       will need to configure the NIS domain and restore any
       changes you had made to rc.nfs and the Makefile.	 Don't
       forget that your	old files were saved in	/lpp/save.config
       with their corresponding	path names.  The passwd	and group
       files are unchanged across a migration install, so the user
       and group information will be retained.


       3.  NetWare

       NetWare is not shipping with AIX	4.1, but with the next
       release.	All user configuration will be preserved.


       4.  X-Stations

       There should be no problems with	XStation bootup	if you do a
       migration.  As previously mentioned, the	/etc/bootptab file
       is migrated.

Configuring a SLIP interface
       The softcopy documentation on configuring a slip interface has
       errors in it.  After using ate or cu to test the connection, the user
       is instructed to change the tty to disable LOGIN.  Before doing
       this, the user must first do a pdisable tty1 to disable getty
       on the tty.  Then the user can do a smit chgtty and disable LOGIN
       and change the baud rate.
