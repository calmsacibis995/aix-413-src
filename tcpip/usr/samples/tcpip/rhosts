# This file, along with the /etc/hosts.equiv file, defines which users on
# foreign hosts are permitted to remotely execute commands on your host
# as your userid.  The rshd, rlogind, lpd, and srcmstr programs all use
# this file to determine remote user access.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
#
# hostname [username]
#
# Both hostname and username can be preceded by a '-' character to deny
# access.  A '+' character can be used in place of hostname or username
# to match any host or user.  If you are using NIS, both the hostname and
# username may be in the form:
#
# +@netgroup
# -@netgroup
#
# where "netgroup" is an NIS netgroup defined in the netgroup map.  The
# '+' form allows access to any host or user in the netgroup, while the
# '-' form denies access to any host or user in the netgroup.
#
# Lines beginning with a '#' character and blank lines are ignored.
#
# Examples:
#
# host user		allows access to user on host
# + user		allows access to user on any host
# host -user		denies access to user on host
# -host			denies access to all users on host
# -@group		denies access to all users on hosts in group
# +@group1 +@group2	allows access to users in group2 on hosts in group1
