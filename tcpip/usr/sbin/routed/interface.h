/*
 * An ``interface'' is similar to an ifnet structure,
 * except it doesn't contain q'ing info, and it also
 * handles ``logical'' interfaces (remote gateways
 * that we want to keep polling even if they go down).
 * The list of interfaces which we maintain is used
 * in supplying the gratuitous routing table updates.
