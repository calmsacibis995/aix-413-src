#
# How to configure this file for your system:
#
# 1. If you want to direct your logging from the configuration file, 
#    set the logging specifications as follows:
#
# 	logging		</path/filename>	enabled|disabled
#	logging		size=<limit>		level=<debug level>
#
#    where </path/filename> specifies the complete path and filename of the 
#    log file, enabled turns logging on, disabled turns logging off, <limit> 
#    specifies the maximum size in bytes of the specified logfile, and 
#    <debug level> specifies the logging level of 0, 1, 2, or 3.  There is no 
#    default logging file.  The enablement default is disabled.  The size 
#    default is 0, meaning unlimited, and the level default is 0.  There can
#    be no white spaces around the "=" in the size and level fields.  There
#    are no restrictions on the order in which the fields are entered in the 
#    logging entries.  A logging entry can contain single or multiple fields.  
#
# 2. Set the community names and access privileges for hosts that can make
#    requests of this snmpd agent.  Define these restrictions as follows:
#
# 	community  <name>  <address>  <netmask>  <permissions>  <view name>
#
#    where <name> is the community name, <address> is either a hostname or
#    an IP address in dotted notation, and <permissions> is one of:  none, 
#    readOnly, writeOnly, readWrite.  The default permission is readOnly.  
#    <netmask> specifies the network mask.  The default address and netmask 
#    are 0.0.0.0.  If an address other than 0.0.0.0 is specified, the default 
#    netmask is 255.255.255.255.  If a permission is specified, both the 
#    address and netmask must also be specified.  <view name> defines a 
#    portion of the MIB tree to which this community name allows access.  
#    <view name> must be defined as a unique object identifier in dotted 
#    numeric notation.  <view name> is further defined in the view 
#    configuration entry.  If <view name> is not specified, the view for 
#    this community defaults to the entire MIB tree.  Fields to the right
#    of <name> are optional, with the limitation that no fields to the
#    left of a specified field are omitted.
#
# 3. Set your MIB views as follows:
#
#	view  <view name>  <MIB subtree>...
#
#    where <view name> is a unique object identifier in dotted numeric
#    notation and <MIB subtree> is a list of the MIB subtrees in text or
#    dotted numeric notation that this view allows access.  The <view name>
#    is the same as that specified in the community configuration entry.  If 
#    the MIB subtree list is not specified, the view defaults to the entire
#    MIB tree. 
#
# 4. If your site has a management station that listens for traps, fill-in
#    the information for the trap destination as follows:
#
#	trap  <community>  <a.b.c.d>   <view name>  <trap mask>
#
#    where <community> is the community name that will be encoded in the 
#    trap packet and <a.b.c.d> is the hostname or IP address in dotted 
#    notation of the host where a trap monitor is listening on UDP port 162.
#    The <view name> is a unique object identifier in dotted notation. View
#    name is not implemented for traps.  The snmpd agent only checks 
#    the view name format and duplication.  The trap mask is in hexidecimal
#    format.  The bits from left to right stand for coldStart trap, warmStart
#    trap, linkDown trap, linkUp trap, authenticationFailure trap,
#    egpNeighborLoss trap, and enterpriseSpecific trap.  The right most bit
#    does not have any meaning.  The value "1" will enable the corresponding
#    trap to be sent. Otherwise, the trap is blocked.  
#       ex.	fe	block no traps (1111 1110)
#		7e	block coldStart trap (0111 1110)
#		be 	block warmStart trap (1011 1110)
#		3e	block coldStart trap and warmStart trap (0011 1110)
#
# 5. Set your snmpd specific configuration parameters as follows:
#
#	snmpd  <variable>=<value>
#
#    where <variable> is one of maxpacket, querytimeout or smuxtimeout.
#    If <variable> is maxpacket, <value> is the maximum packet size, in 
#    bytes, that the snmpd agent will transmit.  The minimum value to 
#    which maxpacket can be set is 300 bytes.  If there is no snmpd entry 
#    for maxpacket, the system socket default limits will be used.  If 
#    <variable> is querytimeout, <value> is the time interval, in seconds, 
#    at which the snmpd agent will query the interfaces to check for 
#    interface status changes.  The minimum value to which querytimeout 
#    can be set is 30 seconds.  If 0 (zero) is specified, snmpd will not 
#    query the interfaces for status changes.  If no snmpd entry for 
#    querytimeout is specified, the default value of 60 seconds is used.  
#    If <variable> is smuxtimeout, <value> is the time interval, in
#    seconds, at which snmpd will timeout on a request to a smux peer.
#    If 0 (zero) is specified, snmpd will not timeout on smux requests.
#    If no snmpd entry for smuxtimeout is specified, the default value
#    of 15 seconds is used.  If <variable> is ethernettimeout, 
#    tokenringtimeout, or fdditimeout, <value> is the maximum time, in
#    seconds, between flushings of the internal cache for variables associated 
#    with the respective device.  If <variable> is smuxtrapaddr, <value> is 
#    defined for either 0 or 1.  If <value> is 0, the trap address on a SMUX
#    generated trap will be the local host's address if the trap originated
#    from a SMUX peer on the local host.  If <value> is 0 and the trap was
#    generated by a remote SMUX peer, the address of the remote machine will be
#    used in the trap.  If <value> is 1, the address of the local machine 
#    (i.e., the machine on which snmpd is running) will be used for all SMUX 
#    generated traps.  The "=" is absolutely required, and no white 
#    spaces are allowed around the "=".  There are no restrictions on 
#    the order in which the fields are entered in the snmpd  entry.  An 
#    snmpd entry can contain single or multiple fields. 
#
# 6. Set the smux peer configuration parameters as follows:
#
#       smux <client OIdentifier> <password> <address> <netmask>
#
#    where <client OIdentifier> is the unique object identifer in dotted
#    decimal notation of the SMUX peer client.  <password> specifies the
#    password that snmpd requires from the SMUX peer client to authenticate
#    the SMUX association.  <address> is either the hostname or IP address 
#    in dotted notation of the host on which the SMUX peer client is 
#    executing.  <netmask> specifies the network mask.  If no password is
#    specified, there is no authentication for the SMUX association. The 
#    default address and netmask are 127.0.0.1 and 255.255.255.255.  If
#    neither the address nor netmask are specified, the SMUX association
#    is limited to the local host.  Fields to the right of 
#    <client OIdentifier> are optional, with the limitation that no fields 
#    to the left of a specified field are omitted.
#
# 7. Set the system contact and system location by:
#
#       syscontact "System Adminstrator"
#       syslocation "Here, City, State, Country, Planet, Universe"
#
#    These variables will be used to define the MIB variables sysContact and 
#    sysLocation respectively.  The values must be within quotes and less
#    than 256 bytes in length.  When one of these MIB variables is set, this
#    file will be appended with the new information.  The system adminstrator
#    should be aware that if there are many settings of these variables, the
#    file will grow and need to be cleaned up.  The rationale for not deleting
#    entries is to allow the system adminstrator a history of variable values.
#    If the values are not set in these files, the snmpd daemon will return a
#    null string.
#
# NOTE:  Comments are indicated by # and continue to the end of the line.
#        There are no restrictions on the order in which the configuration
#        entries are specified in this file.
